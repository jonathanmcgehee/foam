# Introduction

Welcome to my [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) knowledge base. Here I share my daily notes/journal/blog as well as longer writing compositions. Additionally, I will coalesce what I am learning here and use this as a space to grow knowledge, share knowledge, make connections, etc.

>*"Then do not stop to think about the reasons for what you are doing, about why you are questioning. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day. Never lose a holy curiosity."* -Albert Einstein, [Life, May 2, 1955](https://books.google.com/books?id=dlYEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)

# Daily Notes

# Tuesday, July 27, 2021

Looking first thing today at an apartment mold growth problem

Finishing up a report on a clothes washing machine failure

Organized some markdown files for my forensic pathology and diagnosis reference

Started using [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/) today to organize my report references. I like some of the built in features. There was a bit of a learning curve to get going with it and actually use it to generate the '.bib' file for my report.

Starting a report on structure fire damage

# Monday, July 26, 2021

Reading in [[Hope in Times of Fear]]

Getting setup to look at an apartment relative humidity issue.

Finalizing a report and organizing documentation surrounding [[excessive floor deflection]]

Getting setup to look at a retaining wall failure.

On a more complex note, perhaps [the universe is a three-torus?](https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqjkn/the-universe-is-a-giant-donut-that-we-live-inside-new-research-suggests) The more technical version [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13205).

Lunch hour 10 min continuous run

Working on a clothes washing machine failure and water damage report

## Saturday, July 24, 2021

Took the non-functional weedeater to get repaired in [Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin,_Tennessee).

Stopped at Home Depot and picked up some hardware to fix the kitchen cabinet door and install the garage door

Watched an episode of [House M.D.](https://www.amazon.com/House-Season-1/dp/B000WCT7M8) with lunch

Another trip to [Hendersonville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendersonville,_Tennessee). For the third time this week. But this time for a culvert headwall failure.

Still learning and working through things with [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

[[Gracie]]'s new [favorite spot](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Asqj14i852KXtxYP6)

Finished a [LATEX](https://www.latex-project.org/) report on a residential floor failure.

Finished watching season 1 of [Loki](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/loki/6pARMvILBGzF)
