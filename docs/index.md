# Introduction

Welcome to my [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) knowledge base. Here I share my daily notes/journal/blog as well as longer writing compositions. Additionally, I will coalesce what I am learning here and use this as a space to grow knowledge, share knowledge, make connections, etc.

>*"Then do not stop to think about the reasons for what you are doing, about why you are questioning. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day. Never lose a holy curiosity."* -Albert Einstein, [Life, May 2, 1955](https://books.google.com/books?id=dlYEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)
