Another trip to [Hendersonville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendersonville,_Tennessee). For the third time this week. But this time for a culvert headwall failure.

Still learning and working through things with foam, git, GitHub, Markdown, and VSCode.

Finished a LATEX report on a residential floor failure.
