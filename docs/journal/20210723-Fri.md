Another trip to [Hendersonville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendersonville,_Tennessee). For the third time this week. But this time for a culvert headwall failure.

Still learning and working through things with [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#table-of-contents), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

[[Gracie]]'s new [favorite spot](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Asqj14i852KXtxYP6)

Finished a [LATEX](https://www.latex-project.org/) report on a residential floor failure.

Finished season 1 of [Loki](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/loki/6pARMvILBGzF)
