Took the non-functional weedeater to get repaired in [Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin,_Tennessee).

Stopped at Home Depot and picked up some hardware to fix the kitchen cabinet door and install the garage door

Watched an episode of [House M.D.](https://www.amazon.com/House-Season-1/dp/B000WCT7M8) with lunch
