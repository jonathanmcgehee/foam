Discussion of the trap of time management and how more efficiency generally just pushes us to take on more. Instead we need to:
reduce the volume of tasks - this includes refusing to take on things and using time blocking with our synchronous and asynchronous to-dos in order to see the reality of our capacity/space in our calendar
replacing decisions with principles - setup principles that eliminate the need for subsets of decisions, reduce decision fatigue
create structures to eliminate distraction - will power is not sufficient
